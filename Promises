Gen 28 {Promise to Jacob; same as Abraham} {
  10 Jacob left Beersheba and set out for Harran. 
  11 When he reached a certain place, he stopped for the night because the sun had set. 
  Taking one of the stones there, he put it under his head and lay down to sleep.
    
  12 He had a dream in which he saw a stairway resting on the earth, 
  with its top reaching to heaven, 
  and the angels of God were ascending and descending on it. 
  
  13 There above it stood the Lord, and he said: {
      “I am the Lord, the God of your father Abraham and the God of Isaac. 
      I will give you and your descendants the land on which you are lying. 
    14 Your descendants will be like the dust of the earth, 
      and you will spread out to the west and to the east, 
      to the north and to the south. 
      All peoples on earth will be blessed through you and your offspring. 
    15 I am with you and will watch over you wherever you go, 
      and I will bring you back to this land. 
      I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you.”
  }

  16 When Jacob awoke from his sleep, he thought, {
    “Surely the Lord is in this place, and I was not aware of it.” 
  }
  17 He was afraid and said, { 
    “How awesome is this place! 
    This is none other than the house of God; 
    this is the gate of heaven.”
  }

  18 Early the next morning Jacob took the stone he had placed under his head 
  and set it up as a pillar 
  and poured oil on top of it. 
  19 He called that place Bethel, 
  though the city used to be called Luz.

  20 Then Jacob made a vow, saying, {
      “If God will be with me
      and will watch over me on this journey I am taking 
      and will give me food to eat 
      and clothes to wear 
    21 so that I return safely to my father’s household, 
      then the Lord will be my God 
    22 and this stone that I have set up as a pillar will be God’s house, 
      and of all that you give me 
      I will give you a tenth.”
  }

Ps 1 {
  1 Blessed is the one
    who does not walk in step with the wicked
    or stand in the way that sinners take
    or sit in the company of mockers,
  2 but whose delight is in the law of the Lord,
    and who meditates on his law day and night.
  
  3 That person is like a tree planted by streams of water,
    which yields its fruit in season
    and whose leaf does not wither—
    whatever they do prospers.
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  4 Not so the wicked!
    They are like chaff
    that the wind blows away.
  5 Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment,
    nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous.
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  6 For the Lord watches over the way of the righteous,
    but the way of the wicked leads to destruction.
