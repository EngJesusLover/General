Ps 32 {
    1 Blessed is the one
    whose transgressions are forgiven,
    whose sins are covered.
    ---
    2 Blessed is the one
    whose sin the Lord does not count against them
    and in whose spirit is no deceit.
    -------
    3 When I kept silent,
    my bones wasted away
    through my groaning all day long.
    ---
    4 For day and night
    your hand was heavy on me;
    my strength was sapped
    as in the heat of summer.
    -------
    5 Then I acknowledged my sin to you
    and did not cover up my iniquity.
    I said, “I will confess
    my transgressions to the Lord.”
    And you forgave
    the guilt of my sin.
    ---
    6 Therefore let all the faithful pray to you
    while you may be found;
    surely the rising of the mighty waters
    will not reach them.
    ---
    7 You are my hiding place;
    you will protect me from trouble
    and surround me with songs of deliverance.
    -------
    8 I will instruct you and teach you in the way you should go;
    I will counsel you with my loving eye on you.
    ---
    9 Do not be like the horse or the mule,
    which have no understanding
    but must be controlled by bit and bridle
    or they will not come to you.
    10 Many are the woes of the wicked,
    but the Lord’s unfailing love
    surrounds the one who trusts in him.
    ---
    11 Rejoice in the Lord and be glad, you righteous;
    sing, all you who are upright in heart!
}

Ps 1 {
    1 Blessed is the one
    who does not walk in step with the wicked
    or stand in the way that sinners take
    or sit in the company of mockers,
    ---
    2 but whose delight is in the law of the Lord,
    and who meditates on his law day and night.
    ------------
    3 That person is like a tree planted by streams of water,
    which yields its fruit in season
    and whose leaf does not wither—
    whatever they do prospers.
    ----
    4 Not so the wicked!
    They are like chaff
    that the wind blows away.
    ------------
    5 Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment,
    nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous.
    ----
    6 For the Lord watches over the way of the righteous,
    but the way of the wicked leads to destruction.

Ps 139 {
    You have searched me, LORD,
    and You know me.
    You know when I sit and when I rise;
    You perceive my thoughts from afar.
    You discern my going out and my lying down;
    You are familiar with all my ways.
    ---
    Before a word is on my tongue
    You, LORD, know it completely.
    You hen me in behind and before,
    and you lay your hand upon me.
    Such knowledge is too wonderful for me,
    too lofty for me to attain.
    ---
    Where can I go from Your Spirit?
    Where can I flee from Your presence?
    If I go up to the heavens, You are there;
    If I make my bed in the depths, You are there;
    If I rise on the wings of the dawn,
    If I settle on the far side of the sea,
    even there Your hand will guide me,
    Your right hand will hold me fast.
    ---
    If I say, "Surely the darkness will hide me
    and the light become night around me"
    even the darkness will not be dark to You;
    the night will shine like the day,
    for darkness is as light to You.
    -------
    For You created my inmost being;
    You knit me together in my mother's womb.
    I praise You because I am fearfully and wonderfully made;
    Your works are wonderful,
    I know that full well.
    ---
    My frame was not hidden from You
    when I was made in the secret place,
    when I was woven together in the depths of the earth.
    ---
    Your eyes saw my unformed body;
    all the days ordained for me were written in Your book
    before one of them came to be.
    ---
    How precious to me are Your thoughts, God!
    How vast is the sum of them!
    Were I to count them,
    they would outnumber the grains of sand -
    when I awake, I am still with you.
    -------
    If only You, God, would slay the wicked!
    Away from me, you who are bloodthirsty!
    They speak of You with evil intent;
    Your adversaries misuse Your name.
    ---
    Do I not hate those who hate You, LORD,
    and abhor those who are in rebellion against You?
    I have nothing but hatred for them;
    I count them my enemies.
    -------
    Search me, God, and know my heart;
    test me and know my anxious thoughts.
    See if there is any offensive way in me,
    and lead me in the way everlasting.
}


Ps 25 {
  1 In you, Lord my God,
  I put my trust.
  ---
  2 I trust in you;
  do not let me be put to shame,
  nor let my enemies triumph over me.
  ---
  3 No one who hopes in you
  will ever be put to shame,
  but shame will come on those
  who are treacherous without cause.
  ------------
  4 Show me your ways, Lord,
  teach me your paths.
  5 Guide me in your truth and teach me,
  for you are God my Savior,
  and my hope is in you all day long.
  ---
  6 Remember, Lord, your great mercy and love,
  for they are from of old.
  7 Do not remember the sins of my youth
  and my rebellious ways;
  according to your love remember me,
  for you, Lord, are good.
  ------------
  8 Good and upright is the Lord;
  therefore he instructs sinners in his ways.
  9 He guides the humble in what is right
  and teaches them his way.
  ---
  10 All the ways of the Lord are loving and faithful
  toward those who keep the demands of his covenant.
  11 For the sake of your name, Lord,
  forgive my iniquity, though it is great.
  ------------
  12 Who, then, are those who fear the Lord?
  He will instruct them in the ways they should choose.
  13 They will spend their days in prosperity,
  and their descendants will inherit the land.
  ---
  14 The Lord confides in those who fear him;
  he makes his covenant known to them.
  ---
  15 My eyes are ever on the Lord,
  for only he will release my feet from the snare.
  ------------
  16 Turn to me and be gracious to me,
  for I am lonely and afflicted.
  17 Relieve the troubles of my heart
  and free me from my anguish.
  ---
  18 Look on my affliction and my distress
  and take away all my sins.
  19 See how numerous are my enemies
  and how fiercely they hate me!
  ------------
  20 Guard my life and rescue me;
  do not let me be put to shame,
  for I take refuge in you.
  ---
  21 May integrity and uprightness protect me,
  because my hope, Lord, is in you.
  ------------
  22 Deliver Israel, O God,
  from all their troubles!
}


Ps 34 {
    1 I will extol the Lord at all times;
    his praise will always be on my lips.
    2 I will glory in the Lord;
    let the afflicted hear and rejoice.
    3 Glorify the Lord with me;
    let us exalt his name together.
  ------------
    4 I sought the Lord, and he answered me;
    he delivered me from all my fears.
    5 Those who look to him are radiant;
    their faces are never covered with shame.
    ---
    6 This poor man called, and the Lord heard him;
    he saved him out of all his troubles.
    7 The angel of the Lord encamps around those who fear him,
    and he delivers them.
  ------------
    8 Taste and see that the Lord is good;
    blessed is the one who takes refuge in him.
    ---
    9 Fear the Lord, you his holy people,
    for those who fear him lack nothing.
    ---
    10 The lions may grow weak and hungry,
    but those who seek the Lord lack no good thing.
  ------------
    11 Come, my children, listen to me;
    I will teach you the fear of the Lord.
    ---
    12 Whoever of you loves life
    and desires to see many good days,
    13 keep your tongue from evil
    and your lips from telling lies.
    14 Turn from evil and do good;
    seek peace and pursue it.
  ------------
    15 The eyes of the Lord are on the righteous,
    and his ears are attentive to their cry;
    16 but the face of the Lord is against those who do evil,
    to blot out their name from the earth.
    ---
    17 The righteous cry out, and the Lord hears them;
    he delivers them from all their troubles.
    18 The Lord is close to the brokenhearted
    and saves those who are crushed in spirit.
    ---
    19 The righteous person may have many troubles,
    but the Lord delivers him from them all;
    20 he protects all his bones,
    not one of them will be broken.
  ------------
    21 Evil will slay the wicked;
    the foes of the righteous will be condemned.
    22 The Lord will rescue his servants;
    no one who takes refuge in him will be condemned.

Ps 51 {
    1 Have mercy on me, O God,
    according to your unfailing love;
    according to your great compassion
    ---
    blot out my transgressions.
    2 Wash away all my iniquity
    and cleanse me from my sin.
    ---
    3 For I know my transgressions,
    and my sin is always before me.
    4 Against you, you only, have I sinned
    and done what is evil in your sight;
    so you are right in your verdict
    and justified when you judge.
    -------
    5 Surely I was sinful at birth,
    sinful from the time my mother conceived me.
    6Yet you desired faithfulness even in the womb;
    you taught me wisdom in that secret place.
    -------
    7 Cleanse me with hyssop, and I will be clean;
    wash me, and I will be whiter than snow.
    ---
    8 Let me hear joy and gladness;
    let the bones you have crushed rejoice.
    ---
    9 Hide your face from my sins
    and blot out all my iniquity.
    -------
    10 Create in me a pure heart, O God,
    and renew a steadfast spirit within me.
    ---
    11 Do not cast me from your presence
    or take your Holy Spirit from me.
    ---
    12 Restore to me the joy of your salvation
    and grant me a willing spirit, to sustain me.
    -------
    13Then I will teach transgressors your ways,
    so that sinners will turn back to you.
    ---
    14 Deliver me from the guilt of bloodshed, O God,
    you who are God my Savior,
    and my tongue will sing of your righteousness.
    ---
    15 Open my lips, Lord,
    and my mouth will declare your praise.
    -------
    16 You do not delight in sacrifice, or I would bring it;
    you do not take pleasure in burnt offerings.
    ---
    17 My sacrifice, O God, is a broken spirit;
    a broken and contrite heart
    you, God, will not despise.
    -------
    18 May it please you to prosper Zion,
    to build up the walls of Jerusalem.
    19 Then you will delight in the sacrifices of the righteous,
    in burnt offerings offered whole;
    then bulls will be offered on your altar.
}


Ps 23 {
    1 The Lord is my shepherd, I lack nothing.
    2 He makes me lie down in green pastures,
    he leads me beside quiet waters,
    3 he refreshes my soul.
    He guides me along the right paths
    for his name’s sake.
  ------------
    4 Even though I walk
    through the darkest valley,
    I will fear no evil,
    for you are with me;
    your rod and your staff,
    they comfort me.
    ---
    5 You prepare a table before me
    in the presence of my enemies.
    You anoint my head with oil;
    my cup overflows.
  ------------
    6 Surely your goodness and love will follow me
    all the days of my life,
    and I will dwell in the house of the Lord
    forever.

  NKJV {
      1 The Lord is my shepherd;
      I shall not want.
      ---
      2 He makes me to lie down in green pastures;
      He leads me beside the still waters.
      3 He restores my soul;
      He leads me in the paths of righteousness
      For His name’s sake.
      -----------
      4 Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
      I will fear no evil;
      For You are with me;
      Your rod and Your staff, they comfort me.
      ---
      5 You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies;
      You anoint my head with oil;
      My cup runs over.
      ------------
      6 Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me
      All the days of my life;
      And I will dwell in the house of the Lord
      Forever.
