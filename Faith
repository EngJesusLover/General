    I have been crucified with Christ
    and I no longer live but Christ lives in me
    The life I now live in the body,

    I do not set aside the grace of God,
    for if righteousness could be gained thru the Law, Christ died for nothing!

     5 he saved us, 
      not because of righteous things we had done, 
      but because of his mercy. 
      He saved us through the washing of rebirth and renewal by the Holy Spirit, 
    6 whom he poured out on us generously through Jesus Christ our Savior, 
    7 so that, having been justified by his grace, 
      we might become heirs having the hope of eternal life. 
    8 This is a trustworthy saying. 
      And I want you to stress these things, 
      so that those who have trusted in God 
      may be careful to devote themselves to doing what is good. 
      These things are excellent and profitable for everyone.
